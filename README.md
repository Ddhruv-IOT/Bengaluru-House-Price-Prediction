# Real Estate Ho Price Prediction

In this project, the main is to predict the prices of houses available in Bengaluru.
The price is based mainly upon the Area, Number of bedrooms, Bathrooms, and the Locality of the house.

It is a Machine Learning project with frontend and backend support. The front end was developed and deployed using Flask Server. The backend is powered by Sklearn.

For model and modeling, the first step was data preprocessing which includes outlier detection, anomaly detection, variation, and many other things. It was the toughest part I can say. Once the data was cleaned, the next step was model building, for that GridsearchCV was used with linear regression, lasso, and a decision tree. The straight winner was LinerRegression. Once this was done, the last step was to deploy the project using the flask server.
