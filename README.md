# Real Estate Price Prediction

Real Estate Home Price Prediction, In this project, I am predicting the prices various types of houses available in Bengaluru.
The price is based manily upon the squarefeet Area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms ans the locality of the house.
It is a Machine Learning project with full frontend and backend support. The frontend is powered by Flask Server and Backend is powered by SKlearn.
For model and modelling, the first step was data pre-processing including outlire detection, analomy detection, variation and many other things, it was the toughest part I can say. Once data was cleaned, the next setp was of model building, for that GridsearchCV was used with linearRegression, lasso and descison tree. The straight winner was LinerRegression. Once this was done, the last step was to deploy the project using flask server.
